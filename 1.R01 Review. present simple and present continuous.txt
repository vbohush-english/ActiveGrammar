1. Hi Luis.
Thanks for your email.
I'm really pleased that you're enjoying your English course in the UK.
Is your English getting better?
We're all fine here - as always. I don't have much free time at the moment.
I'm practising hard for the tennis competition this year.
Brian think I'm playing well, but I don't think I am.
Do you remember my 'baby sister' Maria?
Well, can you believe she's 13 now?
We still think of her as a little child, but she's very grown-up now.
She is learning to play the violin, and she's already quite good.
She is playing right now, while I'm writing this email.
Right, time to stop writing. I have loads of work to do.
See you soon.
Angela.
